# Brackets

[Brackets](http://brackets.io/) is open source editor from Adobe.
Written in HTML, CSS and Javascript using [CodeMirror](http://codemirror.net/) in a Node.js container.

* [Download Brackets 1.2 for OS X](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/releases/download/release-1.2%2Beb4/Brackets.1.2.Extract.dmg)

## Key Features
* Live browser preview
* Inline CSS editing (Ctrl/Cmd+E)
* A [well-documented open API](http://brackets.io/docs/current/) for plugin developers
* Built-in package manager
* Nested color picker
* Image previewer
* Support new version on every 2-3 weeks
* Less emphasis on server-side languages

## First Impression
* Live browser preview doesn't work on initial example
* Provides better experince than [LiveReload](http://livereload.com/)
* Fine PSD read function
* Confused on indention with base theme (spaces? tabs?)
* If Chrome Dev Tool is opened, it cancels live preview (quite annoying)
